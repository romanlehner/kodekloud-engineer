# Task: Create Namespace in Kubernetes Cluster

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to deploy some micro services on Kubernetes platform. The team has already set up a Kubernetes cluster and now they want set up some namespaces, deployments etc. Based on the current requirements, the team has shared some details as below:



Create a namespace named dev and create a POD under it; name the pod dev-nginx-pod and use nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

# Solution:

    kubectl create ns dev

    kubectl -n dev run dev-nginx-pod --image nginx:latest
